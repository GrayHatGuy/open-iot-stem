- Post installation set-up

	- Update Boards
    
    	*We are using an nRF52 third-party board for this training session you will need to add board support*
        *Arduino has built in board support for many boards but if you use other [third-party boards in](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls) in the future they can also be appended in this location*
    
   		- Verify Arduino is open and use title menu to navigate to: **File>Prefernces>Additional Board Support**
      
    		- Paste the following into the location and click OK to accept

   		  	```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAKwireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index/main/package_rakwireless_index.json```

   			- Select title menu library manager
        
   			- Search
        
			- Install
     
	- Save and reload project
   
 		- Save a working copy of the project file to your /USER/ directory from title menu **File>Save As**  
   
## Edit code
*[5 min]*
*In order for the IoT device to be recognized within the LoRaWAN network you will need to add secret keys to the code these are similar to a username and password*

- Edit code and add secrets and keys

  Show code screen
  
## Compile and build code
*[5 min]*
*To run the code we need to verify the code for errors and check that all necessary libraries and components are installed this is referred as building and/or compiling*

- Click Build button to compile 

  screenshot of build button

- Wait until compile is complete

  	- if compile is complete continue on to [Flash code]	
  	screenshot of good compile

	- if compile fails then see debug

## Flash code
*After the code has completed a successful build/compile we need to upload the program and flash the iot device with the code*

- Verify USB is connected to IoT
  
- Verify IoT is detected

	- If connected COM port will be shown in status bar

  	- If not connected click on status and select port for your IoT
  
- Flash program device

  	- Click Upload button to flash

     	  screenshot of upload button

- Wait for flash to complete
  
	- If successful you will see the following screen and continue to [Verification]

  	screenshot

	- If fails see debug 

  
## Verification
*[10 min]*
- Serial terminal
  - GPS data
  - Sensor data
    
## Debug
*[+15 min]*
*Only necessary if prior steps are unsuccessful*

EXTRAS

*If libraries are missing*

- Download and import using ZIP (alternate expert)- Select title menu ZIP
- Navigate to the ZIP file typically located in *../USER/Downloads/*
- Search the internet (alternate expert)
       
- Check repository /lib
